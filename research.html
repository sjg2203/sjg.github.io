                        It is often assumed that specific regions of the brain participate in the pathophysiology of
                        neurodegeneration, while potential involvements of other brain regions or peripheral mechanisms
                        remains unaddressed. Concurrently, growing evidence now indicates that these pathologies are
                        multi-systemic because of the involvement of various brain regions as well as some other
                        scarcely
                        scrutinised peripheral regions. Adding yet another layer of complexity to an already intricate
                        model,
                        this introduces further intertwined dimensions that raise fundamental questions about the
                        coherence
                        between the already described pathophysiology and the lack of effective therapeutics.

                        Thus, developing ground-breaking computational tools and mathematical frameworks that improve
                        the
                        understanding of emerging brain dynamics in the field is of utmost importance. I investigate
                        these
                        hypotheses and identify novel neural pathways contributing to pathophysiology, using the latest
                        advances in theoretical neuroscience and statistics. In particular, my approach involves
                        clinical
                        and pre-clinical trials to investigate the dynamic coalescence of segregated computational
                        processes during the pre-symptomatic phase of neurodegenerative processes.

                        To undertake this work, I combine deep-learning models, electrophysiology as well as metabolic
                        recordings. These methods reveal latent, yet deeply embedded dynamics, within the complexity of
                        neural networks. Moreover, my growing interest in tackling these hypotheses arises from the
                        fundamental role that these innovative methods hold in redefining our current comprehension of
                        neural networks dynamics under neurodegenerative process.
